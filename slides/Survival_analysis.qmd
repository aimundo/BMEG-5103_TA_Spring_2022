## Introduction

(from _Wikipedia_)

"Survival analysis is a branch of Statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one event occurs.

- What proportion of the population will survive past a certain time?

- Of those that survive, at what rate will they die?
"

## Other Names

- Reliability analysis

- Time-to-event analysis

. . .

### Biomedical Applications

- Cancer studies: time to an event of interest (_survival time_)

    + Time from complete remission to relapse or progression
    
    + Or time from diagnosis to death
    
- Time to heart attack

## Challenges

- Only some individuals have experienced the event

- Survival times will be _unknown_ for a subset of the sample

- Survival times are not normally distributed

. . .

This leads to an important concept: Censoring

<br>

Censoring

. . .

"Censoring means that the total survival time for that subject cannot be accurately determined"

## Censoring

### Causes

- Subject drops out
- Lost to follow-up
- Data is not available
- The study ends before (i.e., subject survived at least until the end of the study, but we don't know what happened after)

## Censoring

### Challenges

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

- Censored survival times _underestimate_ the true time to event

- Subjects 1,3,4,5 and 8 were *censored* before 10 years

## Another Example

From Clark et al. _A prognostic model for ovarian cancer_. BJC. 2001

- Data from an ovarian cancer study
- Patients diagnosed with primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma
    + Between January 1990 and December 1999
- Follow-up data available until the end of 2000
- By that time, 75.9% had died

## Another Example

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/clark_calendar_time.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

R: Relapse <br>
D: Death from ovarian cancer <br>
Do: Death from another cause <br>
A: Attended last clinic visit (were alive!) <br>
L: Loss to follow-up <br>
X: Death

_Dashed vertical line is the date of the last follow-up_

## Another Example

- 4 patients had a non-fatal relapse (R)
- 1 lost at follow-up
- 7 patients died (5 from ovarian cancer)
- The event of interest here is **all-cause** mortality (also called overall survival)


## Another Example

:::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/clark_survival_time.png)

<h7>
&squ; indicates censoring
</h7>


:::

::: {.column width="66%"}

- The data now is plotted using "survival time" <br>
- Nonfatal relapses are ignored <br>
- Those who have not died are **censored** <br><br>

- Q: What would change if we were interested in deaths from ovarian cancer **only?**

## Approach

- For survival data, we usually estimate the Survival Probability (aka Survivor Function)
    + Survival $S(t)$:<br>
    Probability that an individual survives from the time origin to a specific future time $t$
- An additional probability could be also estimated _the hazard probability_ ($h(t)$)

## Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate

- Suppose that $k$ patients have events at distinct times <br>
$$t_1<t_2<t_3<t_4<...<t_k$$
- We assume these events are **independent**: <br> 
We can calculate the cumulative survival probability by multiplying the probabilities of surviving from one interval to the next.

## Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate

$$S(t_j)=S(t_{j-1}) \left( 1-\frac{d_j}{n_j} \right),$$

where:<br>
$S(t_j)$: the probability of being alive at time $t_j$.<br>
$S(t_{j-1})$: probability of being alive at $t_{j-1}$ <br>
$n_j$: number of patients alive just before $t_j$ <br>
$d_j$: number of events at $t_j$

## The Hazard probability

The relationship between $S(t)$ and $h(t)$ is defined by:

$$h(t)=-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}[\log S(t)]$$

- If $S(t)$ is known then $h(t)$ is automatically known (and viceversa).
