## Introduction

(from _Wikipedia_)

"Survival analysis is a branch of Statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one event occurs.

- What proportion of the population will survive past a certain time?

- Of those that survive, at what rate will they die?
"

## Other Names

- Reliability analysis

- Time-to-event analysis

. . .

### Biomedical Applications

- Cancer studies: time to an event of interest

    + Time from complete remission to relapse or progression (**time to event**)


    + Or time from diagnosis to death (**survival time**)
    
- Time to heart attack

## Why can't we do a rm-ANOVA? or a LMEM?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Survival data is _positively skewed_ (long tail to the right)

- In other words, data does not follow a normal distribution

## Challenges

- Only some individuals have experienced the event

- Survival times will be _unknown_ for a subset of the sample


. . .

This leads to an important concept: Censoring

"Censoring means that the total survival time for that subject cannot be accurately determined"

:::

## Censoring

### Causes

- Subject drops out
- Lost to follow-up
- Data is not available
- The study ends before (i.e., subject survived at least until the end of the study, but we don't know what happened after)

## Censoring

### Challenges

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

- Censored survival times _underestimate_ the true time to event

- Subjects 1,3,4,5 and 8 were *censored* before 10 years

## Censoring

- In other words, patients enter the study at $t_0$, and they die at $t_0+t$
- But $t$ is unknown (either still alive or lost to follow-up)
- If the invidual was last known to be alive at time $t_0+c$ the time $c$ is called a _censored survival time_
- Because censoring occurs after the individual entered the study it is known as _right censoring_ (censoring to the right of the of the last known survival time)

## An Example

From Clark et al. _A prognostic model for ovarian cancer_. BJC. 2001

- Data from an ovarian cancer study
- Patients diagnosed with primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma
    + Between January 1990 and December 1999
- Follow-up data available until the end of 2000
- By that time, 75.9% had died

## An Example

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/clark_calendar_time.png)
"Patient time"
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

R: Relapse <br>
D: Death from ovarian cancer <br>
Do: Death from another cause <br>
A: Attended last clinic visit (were alive!) <br>
L: Loss to follow-up <br>
X: Death

_Dashed vertical line is the date of the last follow-up_

## Another Example

- 4 patients had a non-fatal relapse (R)
- 1 lost at follow-up
- 7 patients died (5 from ovarian cancer)
- The event of interest here is **all-cause** mortality (also called overall survival)


## An Example

:::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}

&squ; indicates censoring

::: {.column width="66%"}

- The data now is plotted using "survival time" <br>
- Nonfatal relapses are ignored <br>
- Those who have not died are **censored** <br><br>

:::

## Another example

- From McIllmurray and Turkie (1987), survival times of 24 patients with Dukes' C colorectal cancer.

-
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
data<-read.csv("data/CRC_data.csv")

knitr::kable(head(data), align='c')
```

## Plotting the data

Let's see how the plot looks like:

```{r}
#data$Patient<-as.factor(data$Patient)
    
data %>%
    ggplot()+
    geom_segment(aes(xend=Survival_date,yend=Patient,x=0,y=Patient),size=2)+
    scale_y_reverse()+
    labs(x="Survival/Censored times (Months)",y="Patient No.")+
    geom_point(aes(x=Survival_date,y=Patient,shape=Category,color=Category),size=4,stroke=2)+
    scale_shape_manual(values=c(1,16))+
    theme_classic()+
    theme(text=element_text(size=20))+
    thm1
```

- `Category` indicates censoring (C) or dead (D).

## A word about notation!

- First we rank all survival/censored times from low to high

- Survival times are denoted by $t$ and Censored times are denoted by $t+$:
    + Censored time for patient 1 is **3+**
    + Survival time for patient 2 is **6**

- If there are ties in survival/censored data (like the 3 patients at 12 mo.), censored observations get a higher rank.
    + In this case, survival times are 12, 12 and 12+
    + Ranks would be 8, 9 and 10

## The rationale behind Kaplan-Meier

- "What is the probability that patients will survive a certain length of time?"

-  How we calculate this probability: 

    + The probability of surviving 42 months is the probability of surviving the 42th month having _already_ survived the previous 41 months
    
    + The same rationale applies for surviving 41 mo.: the probability of surviving 41, _already_ survived the previous 40 mo.
    
## The rationale behind Kaplan-Meier

- $p_1$= probability of surviving at least 1 month after enrollment in trial



- $p_{42}$= conditional probability of surviving the 42nd month after having survived month 41

. . .

$$S(42)=p_1\times p_2\times. . .\times p_{42}$$

. . .

Where $S$ denotes the overall probability of surviving 42 months after enrolling in the trial.

## The rationale behind Kaplan-Meier

In general, the probability of survival to time $t$ is

$$S(t)=p_1 \times p_2 \times...\times p_t$$

For any time $t$ (days, months, years, etc.),

. . .

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
p_t= \frac{\text{Number of patients followed for at least } t-1 \\ \text { and who survive day } t} {\text{Number of patients alive at the end of day }t-1}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

## The rationale behind Kaplan-Meier

- For survival data, we usually estimate the Survival Probability (aka Survivor Function)
    + Survival $S(t)$:<br>
    Probability that an individual survives from the time origin to a specific future time $t$

## Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate

- Suppose that $k$ patients have events at distinct times <br>
$$t_1<t_2<t_3<t_4<...<t_k$$
- Think that $t$ denotes the start of a short time interval which ends at $(t+1)$.

- We then use $n_t$ as the number of patients alive at the start of the interval &rarr; these are at _risk_ of death during that short interval afterwards.

## Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate

- We assume these events are **independent**: <br> 
We can calculate the cumulative survival probability by multiplying the probabilities of surviving from one interval to the next.

- We denote the number of patients dying in the short time interval (just after $t$) as $d_t$.

- The number of patients surviving the interval is then $(n_t-d_t)$

- This number in turn becomes the number starting interval $n_{t+1}$

## Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate

We can write then

$$p_t=\frac{(n_t-d_t)}{n_t},$$

which can be estimated also as


$$p_t=1-\frac{d_t}{n_t}.$$

## Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate

- When $d_t=0$ then $p_t=1$, because the number at risk does not change.

- The value of $S(t)$ changes **only** when at least one person dies.

- Therefore, we skip the times when there are no deaths (We don't calculate $S(t)$) 

- Recall that we estimate the probability of surviving at $t$ as the product of all the probabilities up to time $t$

## Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimate

- The succesive probabilites of survival $S(1), S(2)...,S(t)$ are known as the Kaplan-Meier or product-limit estimates of survival.

. . .

$$S(t)=S(t-1) \left( 1-\frac{d_t}{n_t} \right),$$

. . .

where:<br>
$S(t)$: the probability of being alive at time $t$.<br>
$S(t-1)$: probability of being alive at $t-1$ <br>
$n_t$: number of patients alive just before $t$ <br>
$d_t$: number of patients dying (events) at $t$

#Dead will become 1 and censored becomes 0

           conf.int=FALSE,

## Other ways to present the data {.smaller}

:::: columns

::: {.column width="80%"}
```{r,cumulative-plot,echo=FALSE}
ggsurvplot(km_fit,
           conf.int=FALSE,
           fun='event',
           risk.table = TRUE,
           ggtheme=theme_classic(),
           data=data)

```

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
- In certain circumstances, $1-S(t)$ is plotted against $t$: **Cumulative death curve**

    + This is done when the outcome is rare or is of benefit of the patient:
        + Healing of a lesion, achieving pregnancy, etc.
        
:::
::::

## Median Survival Time: No Censored Obs.

- The time for which 50% of the population survives

- If there are no censored observations (e.g., all the patients in a trial have died), the median survival time $M$, is estimated:

    + By the middle observation of the ranked survival times $t_{(1)}, t_{(2)},...,t_{(n)}$ if the number of observations is odd
    + Average of $t_{n/2}$ and $t_{(n/2+1)}$ if $n$ is even 


## Median Survival Time: Censored Obs.

- When there are censored survival times, $M$ is calculated by obtaining the Survival curve and then, finding the value that satisfies:

. . .
$$S(M)=0.5$$

- Extend a horizontal line from $S(t)=0.5$ until the curve is met, and then move vertically down


## Median Survival Time

```{r,survival-median, echo=FALSE}
ggsurvplot(km_fit,
           conf.int=FALSE,
           risk.table = TRUE,
           ggtheme=theme_classic(),
           surv.median.line="hv",
           data=data)
```


## Confidence Intervals {.smaller}

- How reliable are the estimates of the Kaplan-Meier curve?

- We need to estimate confidence intervals (CIs) to answer this

- There is some math behind this, but the main point is that the interval is estimated using:

. . .

$$S(t) \pm 1.96 \times SE(S(t))$$
- Where $SE$ is the standard error (calculated using Greenwod's formula)

- Any familiarity with the 1.96 in the equation?
    - We are assuming normally distributed _estimates_, and 95% of the area in a normal distribution is within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean
    
## Three Treatment Groups Example

- Data from one of the first successful trials of adjuvant chemo. in colorectal cancer.
- Analyzing subset of 929 patients where death was the event of interest
- 3 treatment groups: 
    + Control ("Observation")
    + Levimasole ("Lev")
    + Levimasole+5-FU ("amisole")

## Three Treatment Groups Example

```{r,colon-trial,echo=FALSE}

data2<-colon

#Only analyzing death 
data2<-filter(data2,etype==2)

colon_fit<-survfit(Surv(time,status)~rx,data=data2)

ggsurvplot(colon_fit,
           conf.int=TRUE,
           risk.table = TRUE,
           legend.title="Treatment",
           palette=c("#2F143F","#95AE90","#DBFABF"),
           surv.median.line = "hv",
           xlim=c(0,max(data2$time)),
           ggtheme=theme_classic(),
           data=data2)
```

## So far...

- We defined and calculated $S(t)$

- Created Survival Curve

- Added the CIs

- How do we compare two survival curves?

## What We Can't Do

- Longitudinal data **can't** be analyzed using cross-sectional tests (t-test, one way ANOVA, etc.)

- The reason is that a single time point gives a biased perception of what actually is going on namely, ignores the effect of **time**

## The Log-rank Test: Rationale

- If two treatments have the same effect, the survival curves should be different only due to random variation in the sampling process

- How can we know that the difference between two Survival Curves is caused by the effect of treatment?

- In other words, we want to test that:

    + $H_o$: There is no difference between the treatment groups survival curves
    + This means that if we fail to reject $H_o$ the probability of a death occuring at any time point is the same in each treatment group.

Bewick, Cheek, Ball. _Critical Care_. 2004

## The Log-rank Test

- We compute a $\chi^2$ statistic: Compare the observed results with expected results using categorical data

- The test statistic is calculated in terms of the observed _(O)_, and expected _(E)_ values.

- _O_: total number of observed deaths in each group

- _E_: Sum of the expected number of deaths at the time of each death (i.e., risk of death at that time multiplied by the number alive int he group).


## How it works

- We first rank the survival times in each group (if a death and a censored observation are tied, the censored observation is allocated a higher rank)

- We then rank **all observations**, irrespective of group



## The Log-rank test

$$\chi^2(\text{log rank})= \frac{(O_A-E_A)^2}{E_A} + \frac{(O_B-E_B)^2}{E_B}$$

## The Hazard Probability

The relationship between $S(t)$ and $h(t)$ is defined by:

$$h(t)=-\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}[\log S(t)]$$

- If $S(t)$ is known then $h(t)$ is automatically known (and viceversa).
